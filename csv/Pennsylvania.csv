My most profitable company, Corporate Cleaners started in 2008 and is still providing a solid income for our family. There is nothing like owning your own company! In 2017 at 48 years old, I checked off a bucket list item by completing my MBA at Lehigh University. During my time there I was able to think and explore. While in that mindset of self exploration, I found myself on the banks of the Lehigh River watching 1,000 boaters go by me in a 4 hour period during a summer picnic in Lehighton. That experience inspired me to follow a passion and opened my eyes to an opportunity to provide recreational kayaking on the Lehigh River through Historic Bethlehem.

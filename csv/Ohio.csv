I take pride in servicing Erie & Lorain counties. Areas of expertise include residential, commercial, and apartment cleaning. C&L Carpet Cleaning was named after my two kids Colin and Lauren. Then the motto was born, ""We put the C and L in ""Clean"". I started carpet cleaning in 1994 when I was not satisfied with the services I was hiring out to clean my own rental properties. I then started cleaning my own and migrated to empty rentals for other property owners. In 2009, during the economic down turn I was downsized from a major corporation and decided to create C&L Carpet Cleaning.
